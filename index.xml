The ∨∑ (orsum) new toy language I am not a professional programmer. In fact, I have never finished any significant piece of software outside of small, closed, academic circles. I am a physicist. And I have written loads of one-off analysis software within mathematics, physics, and computer vision. I like programming. I enjoy trying new programming languages, just to see if they are more suited for various tasks.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://sksg.github.io/blog/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sksg.github.io/blog/about/</guid><description>About this blog This is where I collect my general thoughts on programming, languages, tools, and frameworks. But mostly, it is where I explore the development of my toy-language ∨∑ (orsum).
About SKSG I am a schooled engineer in physics and nanotechnology. I have pursued an academic carreer in nanoelectronics and later computer vision (see Google scholar). Now, however, I am employed as a medical imaging systems engineer. I consider myself a more-than-a-hobbyist programmer with many unfinished projects (see my random code at Github).</description></item></channel></rss>
