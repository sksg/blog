Let me start this first post by explaining a little about what to expect in this blog.

# The ∨∑ (orsum) new toy language

I am not a professional programmer. In fact, I have never finished any significant piece of software outside of small, closed, academic circles. I have, however, written loads of code and one-off analysis software within mathematics, physics, and computer vision. I have come to enjoy trying out a new programming languages, just to see if they were more suited to various tasks.

Some years ago I stumbled onto one of Jon Blows presentations about Jai[^BlowVideos]: A Programming Language for Games. It occurred to me then; building your own language may not be an impossible task. And so begins my journey towards my own programming language.

I am a heavy C++ and Python user. Naturally, I want to make something at least as good as either of those, while also fixing some stuff I know can be improved. I knew right from the start, this language was to be a systems language. Not so much because I wanted to build OS's or anything similar to that. But because system languages always felt *right* to me. The explicity and power always drew me in. However, I also knew that I do not want to forget about mathmatical analysis nor the ability to quickly prototype something. I started to compile my own wish list:

My programming language must be:
- a systems language,
- a mathematical language,
- a *scribling* language, and
- an easy language.

Many, including myself, will see a lot of conflict in the above goals. But I wanna try it out! That is what this blog is all about. During the development process, I also hope to write tutorials, research, notes, and ideas. Anything, really, that could be interesting to write about (within programming).

## The name?

Of course, I cannot embark on this adventure without a name. After some heafty debate with some fellow scientists and programming hobbyists, we came up with nothing. Finally, we gave up and decided what ever the name should be, it should be awesome. And that is what we called it... ∨∑ (orsum). And I have to say, it is great to be able to call the source code ∨∑ source[^OrsumSource]. That just sounds right.

[^OrsumSource]: With my Danish accent, it really sounds like saying *awesome sauce*.
