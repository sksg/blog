# About this blog

*It just this programmers blog... y'know*[^HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy]

[^HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy]: To rephase an excellent quote from *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams, New York :Harmony Books, 1980*.

This is where I collect my general thoughts on programming, languages, tools, and frameworks. But mostly, it is where I explore the development of my toy language ∨∑ (orsum).

# About SKSG

I am a schooled engineer in physics and nanotechnology. I have pursued an academic carreer in nanoelectronics and later computer vision[^GoogleScholar]. Now, however, I am employed as a medical imaging systems engineer. I consider myself a more-than-a-hobbyist programmer with many unfinished projects[^GithubProfile].

[^GoogleScholar]: See all my scientific contributions at [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?hl=da&pli=1&user=MUqqiF8AAAAJ).

[^GithubProfile]: Feel free to browse through my collection of random code at [Github](https://github.com/sksg).
